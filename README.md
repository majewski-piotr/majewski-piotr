## Hello there!

It's very nice of you to visit my github profile!
Feel free to collaborate & raise any issues on my repos, all feedback is appreciated!

### About me
My name, as you've probably guessed, is Piotr. Im from Poland, 30yo at the moment of writing this, and I'm lucky enough to work as a software engineer. I starter my adventure with programming and overall IT quite recently, but it brings me a lot of joy and I plan to continue on this path.

Hello there, my name is Piotr Majewski and I work as a software engineer.

I’m familiar with java 8, a bit of kotlin, groovy and bash, as well as bits of docker, jenkins and AWS, currently learning to pass OCA 1Z0-808 exam.
I’d love to collaborate with you on my [discord bot](https://github.com/majewski-piotr/wodbot) for World of Darkness :vampire: roleplay, appreciate any feedback and ideas.

Contact me here or on [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/piotr-majewski-691784157/)
